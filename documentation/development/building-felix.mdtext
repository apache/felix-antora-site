Title: Building Felix

A basic start to checking-out and building Felix including all sub projects:
1. Download and install the latest Maven 3 release.
1. Check out or update the Felix trunk (i.e., `svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/felix/trunk felix`).
1. Go to the top of the project and type: "mvn clean install" to build all sub projects.
1. To run the newly built framework, cd into *main* and type "java \-jar bin/felix.jar".
