Title: Building Felix

In most cases you might only be interested in one or two sub projects. However, you still might want to check out all sub projects in one go.

To get started:

- Most Apache Felix projects use Apache Maven as the build tool. Therefore, download and install the latest Apache Maven 3 release.
- Check out or update the Felix trunk (i.e., `svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/felix/trunk felix`).
- Go to sub project you're interested in and type: "mvn clean install" to build it. If this project is not using Maven, refer to the docs for the sub project on how to build it.
