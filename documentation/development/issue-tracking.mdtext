Title: Issue Tracking

This project uses [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), a J2EE-based, issue tracking and project management application. We use it for bugs, tasks and code contributions.

Before creating a new issue, please make sure nobody has already added the issue you're reporting. When you do add an issue, please try to make it as informative as possible.

The issue tracker can be found at [http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX)
