# Apache Felix Subproject Documentation

## Building Apache Felix

The Felix project is organized into subprojects, where each subproject targets a specific OSGi specification or OSGi-related technology. Most of these projects are in a single git repository, some have moved into separate git repositories.

Use the below table of subprojects to find the git repository for that subproject, if you want to checkout the [main git repository](https://github.com/apache/felix-dev.git) with most subprojects use `git clone https://github.com/apache/felix-dev.git`, otherwise use the git repository mentioned in the table.

To get started:

- Most Apache Felix projects use Apache Maven as the build tool. Therefore, download and install the latest Apache Maven 3 release.
- Check out or update the git repository (see above).
- Go to the sub project you're interested in and type: "mvn clean install" to build it. If this project is not using Maven, refer to the docs for the subproject on how to build it.
