Title: UPnP Acknowledgments

The Felix UPnP base driver and related bundles were originally developed by the [Domoware ](http://domoware.isti.cnr.it/) project which targeted the OSGi R3. The driver is based on a modified version of the "UPnP for Java" library released by the [Cyberlink |http://www.cybergarage.org/net/upnp/java/index.html] project. This version, called CyberDomo, is currently maintained by the Domoware project team and aligned to the Cyberlink library regularly.
