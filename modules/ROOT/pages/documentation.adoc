Title: Documentation

In an effort to make it easier to find desired documentation, we have divided our documentation section into the following six areas:

* link:{{ refs.getting-started.path }}[Getting started] - This area captures a few links from the areas below that will help you get started with Felix.
* link:{{ refs.faqs.path }}[FAQs] - This area captures all FAQ documentation, which typically varies from subproject to subproject.
* link:{{ refs.community.path }}[Community] - This area captures documentation associated with how the Felix community works and how to become involved in it.
* link:{{ refs.development.path }}[Development] - This area captures documentation for Felix developers or those interested in becoming Felix developers;
this is not intended for Felix users although some information may be useful.
* link:{{ refs.subprojects.path }}[Subprojects] - This area captures user documentation for the various Felix subprojects.
* link:{{ refs.tutorials-examples-and-presentations.path }}[Tutorials, examples, and presentations] - This area captures general user documentation that does not necessarily fit into any single subproject.

In addition a https://felix.apache.org/sitemap.html[site map] is available as a table of contents of the site.

If you are unable to find the documentation you need, please ask on the link:{{ refs.mailinglists.path }}[mailing lists].
Also, feedback on improving the documentation and/or organization of this site is welcome.

_The Felix web site and documentation are managed with the https://www.apache.org/dev/cms.html[Apache CMS].
For Apache Felix specific extensions see the link:{{refs.site-how-to.path}}[Site How-To]._
