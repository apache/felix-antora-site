= Supported OSGi Implementations

So, it is possible to use it on others OSGi implementations.*

ALERT: Old version of Knopflerfish does not allow getting a service during its unregistration.
To enable this feature, launch the Knopflerfish framework with the  `-Dorg.knopflerfish.servicereference.valid.during.unregistering=true` property.
You can add this property in the `props.xargs` file.

Recent version of KF does no more require this property.
