= Apache Felix OSGi Core

The Apache Felix OSGi Core sub-project simply repackages the standard OSGi core API packages provided by the OSGi Alliance into a Maven module.
Nearly all OSGi-related projects will have a dependency on this module if using Maven or will require this module's JAR file in its class path in order to compile against the OSGi core APIs.
The Felix framework has a compile-time dependency on the OSGi core module, but at packaging time it embeds the specific set of required packages so there is no longer a dependency on the module at execution time.
