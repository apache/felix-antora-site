|===
| The Felix UPnP base driver and related bundles were originally developed by the http://domoware.isti.cnr.it/[Domoware] project which targeted the OSGi R3.
The driver is based on a modified version of the "UPnP for Java" library released by the [Cyberlink
| http://www.cybergarage.org/net/upnp/java/index.html] project.
This version, called CyberDomo, is currently maintained by the Domoware project team and aligned to the Cyberlink library regularly.
