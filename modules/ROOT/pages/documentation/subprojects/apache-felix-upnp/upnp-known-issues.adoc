= Known issues

Currently the bundle does not support the following requirements:

* upnp.ssdp.address Configuration Service
* exported device changes: if a service already exported as UPnP Device changes its own configuration, i.e.: implements new service, changes the friendly name, etc., the new service description is not reflected on the UPnP Device
* icons for exported device are not tested
* no localization support
