= Board Reports

The Apache Felix project must submit quarterly reports to the Apache board.
This page serves as a collection point for all submitted board reports.
The reports are listed in chronological order, so the most recent board reports is last.
Submitted board reports will be labeled as _[SUBMITTED]({{ refs.submitted.path }})_, but the most recent board report may be labeled _[NOT SUBMITTED]_ while it is being created;
once finalized and submitted then it will also be labeled as _[SUBMITTED]_.
The [Apache Felix Board Report Template] provides a proper starting point for creating a board report.
