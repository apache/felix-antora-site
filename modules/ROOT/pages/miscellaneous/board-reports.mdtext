Title: Board Reports

The Apache Felix project must submit quarterly reports to the Apache board. This page serves as a collection point for all submitted board reports. The reports are listed in chronological order, so the most recent board reports is last. Submitted board reports will be labeled as *\[SUBMITTED]({{ refs.submitted.path }})*, but the most recent board report may be labeled *\[NOT SUBMITTED]* while it is being created; once finalized and submitted then it will also be labeled as *\[SUBMITTED]*. The [Apache Felix Board Report Template] provides a proper starting point for creating a board report.
