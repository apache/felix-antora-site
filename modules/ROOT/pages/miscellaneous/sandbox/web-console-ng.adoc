* Support OSGi RFC-182 natively (see the http://www.osgi.org/Download/File?url=/download/osgi-early-draft-2012-10.pdf[OSGi Early Draft 2012.10] for details) (Stable/defined RESTful API)
* Configuration Printers: support machine processable formats like returning json (right now we have text and html) ...
