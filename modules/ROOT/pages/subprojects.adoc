== Building Apache Felix

The Felix project is organized into subprojects, where each subproject targets a specific OSGi specification or OSGi-related technology.
Most of these projects are in a single git repository, some have moved into separate git repositories.

Use the below table of subprojects to find the git repository for that subproject, if you want to checkout the https://github.com/apache/felix-dev.git[main git repository] with most subprojects use `+git clone https://github.com/apache/felix-dev.git+`, otherwise use the git repository mentioned in the table.

To get started:

* Most Apache Felix projects use Apache Maven as the build tool.
Therefore, download and install the latest Apache Maven 3 release.
* Check out or update the git repository (see above).
* Go to the sub project you're interested in and type: "mvn clean install" to build it.
If this project is not using Maven, refer to the docs for the subproject on how to build it.
